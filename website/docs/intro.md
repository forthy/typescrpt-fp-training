# Functional Programming with TypeScript

This is a project that demonstrates how functional programming can be applied to TypeScript development.

## Getting Started

### **Fastify test**
run `npm run start` to start a Fastify server locally on port `8888` because of the `FASTIFY_PORT` defined in the .env file. Please try `curl -v http://localhost:8888/v1/hello` to see the result.

### **feature tests**
run `npm run test` to run all feature test cases
